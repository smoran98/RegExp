# RegExp
This problem set is about regular expressions in Go. 
Create a single Git repository as your submission, complete with README and gitignore files. 
NB: after completing each exercise, commit your code - there should be at least one commit per exercise. 
You will be required to submit a URL to the repository and the use of GitHub is recommended for this purpose. 
All code should be fully commented, and the README should explain how to clone your repository and run the code.
